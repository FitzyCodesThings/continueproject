### This project was started with the goal of promoting mental health and suicide prevention in the engineering and software development industries.

We aim to support a few groups of people:

1) Developers and engineers who feel isolated and need support
2) Developers and engineers who want to better support their loved ones in need
3) Loved ones of developers and engineers who don't know how to help
