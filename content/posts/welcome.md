## Life is no simple thing.

This project is a recognition of that fact.

It is a recognition that we all - well or ill, successful or still striving - need a hand now and then.

It is to be a source of help, of hope, of inspiration to those in need of it.

We aim to provide resources for and support of initiatives focused on suicide prevention and mental health awareness.

We are engineers. We are software developers. We are people of the modern age.

We are humans, and we continue.
