<h2 id="whats-this-all-about-then">What&rsquo;s this all about then?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We are developers, engineers, and technologists who recognize the importance of mental health in our lives and support each other with resources and space for discussion as colleagues and friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the stigma around discussing our mental health as humans has steadily decreased, I feel like <code>we tech people still just don't talk about it enough.</code></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even necessarily think it&rsquo;s to do with the stigma so much as it&rsquo;s that we tend to be solitary by nature. We (or at least I) like to hole up and get stuck into our code or projects and shut the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; out.</p>
<p>So what happens when we DO need help?</p>
<p>When we hit burnout?</p>
<p>When impostor syndrome shuts us down?</p>
<p>When we become depressed or anxious?</p>
<p>Who do we turn to when our entire modus operandi is to put our headphones on and shut the world out?</p>
<p>For too many, for too long, the answer has been no one. <code>We ignore it until it can't be ignored, and then we're down for the count.</code> Our work suffers, our relationships suffer, and we suffer.</p>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S what this project is about.</p>
<h3 id="first-foremost-and-always-this-is-a-community-in-which-we-are-free-to-discuss-these-issues-and-encouraged-to-support-each-other-in-pursuit-of-better-mental-health">First, foremost, and always, this is a community in which we are free to discuss these issues and encouraged to support each other in pursuit of better mental health.</h3>
<p>From coping skills to avoiding burnout and impostor syndrome to just needing someone to <code>hear us,</code> the Continue Project is for every developer, engineer, and technologist who ever needs the support of <code>people who get it.</code></p>
<h2 id="where-to-find-us">Where to Find Us</h2>

<h2 id="you-mentioned-a-giveaway">You mentioned a giveaway?</h2>
<p>I did!</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of the project, we&rsquo;re giving away $500+ of &ldquo;stuff.&rdquo; Entries are open through <strong>November 30th, 2020.</strong></p>
<p><strong>First prize</strong> (1 winner) will receive a <em>1 year subscription to Pluralsight</em> AND <em>a piece of &ldquo;merch&rdquo; of your choice</em> shipped anywhere in the world we can reach.</p>
<p>(I chose the Pluralsight subscription, by the way, because one of my favorite ways to get out of my head is to learn something new.)</p>
<p><strong>Four other winners</strong> will also receive a piece of merch of their choice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finalizing the initial designs for that merch and will certainly share them out ahead of time.</p>
<p><strong>To enter the kick-off giveaway, just visit the link below and enter with any or all of the available options.</strong></p>
<h3 id="enter-the-giveawayhttpsgleamiogn1cmthe-continue-project-kickoff"><a href="https://gleam.io/GN1cM/the-continue-project-kickoff">Enter the Giveaway</a></h3>
<p>The goal, obviously, is to help spread the word as far and wide as possible.</p>
<p>So anywhere you find a developer or engineer or technologist who could benefit from this space (I hope that&rsquo;s all of us), share the links. We never know who we might save from crisis or even just a bad day that could be made better if only they&rsquo;d found us.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to get this off the ground. I know how important my network of friends and confidants has been and is to me when I&rsquo;m going through these things, and I&rsquo;m proud to be working with a number of other technologists, content creators, and friends to make that available to others.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll join us. I hope you&rsquo;ll ask when you need help. I hope you&rsquo;ll share the resources you&rsquo;ve cultivated on your journey. I hope you&rsquo;ll lend an ear to our friends who need to be heard.</p>
<p>I hope we&rsquo;ll all wake up, day after day, more at peace with ourselves and the lives we lead.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <title>Initial Thoughts</title>
            <link>https://continueproject.com/posts/initial-thoughts/</link>

            <description>This project sprang out of seemingly nowhere.
I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about mental health and well-being for all of my adult life. I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about it in the context of my own life and demons, and I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about it with regard to those I love.
It ain&amp;rsquo;t easy.
I feel like my community - that of software developers and engineers - is underserved with regard to mental health and suicide prevention, and so the idea for this project began to form.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This project sprang out of seemingly nowhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about mental health and well-being for all of my adult life. I&rsquo;ve thought about it in the context of my own life and demons, and I&rsquo;ve thought about it with regard to those I love.</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t easy.</p>
<p>I feel like my community - that of software developers and engineers - is underserved with regard to mental health and suicide prevention, and so the idea for this project began to form.</p>
<p>But it has only <em>just</em> begun to form.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-continue-project-is-or-will-be">What The Continue Project Is (Or Will Be)</h2>
<p>There are a few things I definitely want to include as part of this project (subject to discussion with other founding members).</p>
<ol>
<li>A safe online space for discussion and community focused on those in the engineering and software development professions</li>
<li>A place for public discussion with willing participants about the lives we lead and how we address our own mental health and well-being</li>
<li>A source of resources for those in crisis or just in need of someone to listen</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not all it will be, but it&rsquo;s a start. Or at least the start of a plan.</p>
<p>Bottom line: I want to create a community where discussion about these issues is not stigmatized or frightening for people who might never have had the opportunity to feel safe speaking about them.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-continue-project-is-not">What The Continue Project Is NOT</h2>
<p>First and foremost, we are not mental health professionals and so we cannot and do not offer medical advice.</p>
<p>We are also not currently a registered non-profit organization, and so we will not be directly accepting donations or operating as a business entity.</p>
<p>We will announce plans for how to handle financial contributions on behalf of The Continue Project in the near future.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-hope-will-happen-next">What I Hope Will Happen Next</h2>
<p>What I hope above all else is that our community will <code>take ownership</code> in this project.</p>
<p>What I mean is that I want the community to drive what this community does.</p>
<p>To craft the resources we make available to each other from content to counseling references.</p>
<p>To find the <em>other</em> resources and organizations that could use more awareness or funding so that we can support each other together.</p>
<p>My plan for starting the process of getting there is to reach out to the coders, engineers, and media creators I already know and try to talk them into taking part, and then they can spread the word and bring in more folks, and so on.</p>
<p>I have a few more ideas in mind, as well, but I&rsquo;m going to let them marinate a bit and wait for feedback from others.</p>
<p>In any event, if you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re helping.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll stick around. I hope you&rsquo;ll take part (as much or as little as you can or wish to). I hope you&rsquo;ll lean on us when you need us (and feel good about seeking deeper help if you need it).</p>
<p>I hope for much, and I am grateful for all.</p>
<p>Until next time,<br>
John &ldquo;Fitzy&rdquo; DeLancey</p>

            <description>Life is no simple thing. This project is a recognition of that fact.
It is a recognition that we all - well or ill, successful or still striving - need a hand now and then.
It is to be a source of help, of hope, of inspiration to those in need of it.
We aim to provide resources for and support of initiatives focused on suicide prevention and mental health awareness.</description>
