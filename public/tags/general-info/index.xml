      <description>This project sprang out of seemingly nowhere.
I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about mental health and well-being for all of my adult life. I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about it in the context of my own life and demons, and I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about it with regard to those I love.
It ain&amp;rsquo;t easy.
I feel like my community - that of software developers and engineers - is underserved with regard to mental health and suicide prevention, and so the idea for this project began to form.</description>

      <description>Life is no simple thing. This project is a recognition of that fact.
It is a recognition that we all - well or ill, successful or still striving - need a hand now and then.
It is to be a source of help, of hope, of inspiration to those in need of it.
We aim to provide resources for and support of initiatives focused on suicide prevention and mental health awareness.</description>
